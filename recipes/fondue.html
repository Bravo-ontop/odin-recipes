<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Swiss cheese fondue is a delectable, communal dish that epitomizes comfort and 
indulgence. This traditional Swiss recipe involves melting a blend of Gruyère and
 Emmental cheeses with white wine, garlic, and a hint of nutmeg, creating a rich, 
 smooth, and velvety cheese sauce. The mixture is heated in a communal pot, 
 called a caquelon, over a gentle flame, allowing the cheese to remain molten and
  perfect for dipping. To enjoy this dish, diners use long forks to skewer pieces
   of crusty bread or vegetables, immersing them in the gooey, flavorful cheese.
    The result is a warm, aromatic experience that invites both conviviality and 
    culinary delight, making Swiss cheese fondue a beloved centerpiece for social
     gatherings and cozy meals.</p>

     <h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li> Gruyère cheese - 200-250 grams (about 7-9 ounces)</li>
    <li>Emmental cheese - 200-250 grams (about 7-9 ounces)</li>
    <li>Dry white wine - 200 ml (about 7 ounces)</li>
    <li>Garlic clove - 1, peeled and halved</li>
    <li>Cornstarch - 1-2 tablespoons</li>
    <li>Freshly ground black pepper - to taste</li>
    <li>Ground nutmeg - a pinch</li>
   <li>Bread - crusty French or Italian bread, cut into bite-sized cubes</li>
   
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>

<li><em>Prepare Ingredients</em> Grate the Gruyère and Emmental cheeses and set them aside. Cut 
    the bread into bite-sized cubes and, if desired, prepare any vegetables for 
    dipping.</li>

<li><em>Rub the Caquelon:</em> Take the garlic clove, cut it in half, and rub the inside of a fondue 
    pot (caquelon) with the cut sides of the garlic to impart a subtle garlic flavor.
</li>

<li><em>Heat the Wine:</em> Pour the dry white wine into the caquelon 
    and heat it over medium heat on the stove until it begins to
     simmer. Avoid boiling.</li>

<li><em>Add Cheese:</em> Gradually add the grated cheese to the simmering wine, stirring continuously
     in a figure-eight motion to help the cheese melt evenly and avoid clumping.</li>

<li><em>Thicken the Mixture:</em> Once the cheese is fully melted and smooth, mix the cornstarch with the kirsch (if using) 
    and add this mixture to the cheese. Stir well to combine and thicken
     the fondue.</li>

<li><em>Season:</em> Add freshly ground black pepper and a pinch of nutmeg to taste,
     stirring until well incorporated.</li>

<li><em>Transfer and Serve:</em> Once the fondue is smooth and bubbling, transfer the pot to a fondue stand with a burner to keep it 
    warm. Serve with bread cubes and optionally with blanched vegetables for 
    dipping.</li>

<li><em>Enjoy:</em> Use long fondue forks to skewer the bread or vegetables and dip them into the melted
     cheese, savoring the rich and creamy flavors of your Swiss cheese fondue.</li>
